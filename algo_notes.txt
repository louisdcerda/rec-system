 content based fileter:
	reccomends based on history of prefs and behaviors 
	
	have to keep users data for training ( search, browser, purchase, etc.) 
	
	reccomends items similair to the ones the user has interacted with before


	mgiht be good for discovering, feature: try this based on trending and interest

collaborative filtering:
	clumps up users and recs based on similair user's data
	might be good since not much data atm and clump up similair users 
	
	reccomends things that one user has watched or used to others in the clump 

	look into user user ad item item collaborative filtering 

hybrid systems:
	use a combination of both: 
		content based filtering to rec items similair user has interacted with before 
		collab filtering to rec similair user likes
	


might use hybrid system 

use k nearest neighbores to begin doing some testing 


just find some data to test rec algo
